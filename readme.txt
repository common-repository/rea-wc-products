== Description ==

REA Products for WooCommerce is a plugin maintained by reainc.net that allows you to share your WooCommerce active products with another site.  The Plugin is installed on your WooCommerce website, and you generate a key/token for a domain that allows that other website to 'request' products to be displayed on the external website.  There are filtering capabilities so you can limit what products are shown on the external website.

The plugin include the image and link allowing someone to 'click' on the product and be redirected to the WooCommerce site for purchases.
